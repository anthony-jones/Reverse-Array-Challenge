# ReverseArrayChallenge
Write a method called reverse() with an int array as a parameter.

The method should not return any value. In other words,
the method is allowed to modify the array parameter.

In main() test the reverse method and
print the array both reversed and non-reversed. 

For example, if the array is { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 
then the reversed array is { 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}.
